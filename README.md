## 🚀 The Problem We’re Solving

Despite growing awareness, neurodivergent individuals continue to face persistent challenges:

- **Lack of Sensory-Friendly Platforms:** Most digital spaces are overwhelming and overstimulating  
- **Scattered Information:** Resources are unstructured, overly clinical, or difficult to understand  
- **Stigma & Social Isolation:** Many individuals feel misunderstood or judged  
- **Limited Practical Guidance:** Everyday coping strategies are rarely accessible  
- **Accessibility Gaps:** Websites often fail to accommodate neurodivergent needs  

**Sensory Hub** addresses these gaps by providing a **calm, accessible, and empathetic digital space** designed specifically for individuals with autism and ADHD.

## 💫 Impact & Purpose

Sensory Hub is created to ensure that support, understanding, and guidance for individuals with autism and ADHD are accessible to everyone, regardless of background, location, or resources. Despite growing awareness around neurodiversity, many individuals still lack safe, sensory-friendly spaces that offer both emotional support and practical guidance.

This platform is designed to reduce stigma, promote self-acceptance, and empower neurodivergent individuals by providing clear, easy-to-understand resources and a welcoming environment. Sensory Hub supports not only individuals with autism and ADHD, but also parents, caregivers, educators, and advocates seeking reliable information and inclusive practices.

By prioritizing accessibility, empathy, and inclusion, Sensory Hub contributes toward building a more understanding society. The project aligns with the **UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education)** by promoting inclusive, equitable, and lifelong learning opportunities for all learners, particularly those who are often underserved or misunderstood.
