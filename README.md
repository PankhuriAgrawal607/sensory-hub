## 🚀 The Problem We’re Solving

Despite growing awareness, neurodivergent individuals continue to face persistent challenges:

- **Lack of Sensory-Friendly Platforms:** Most digital spaces are overwhelming and overstimulating  
- **Scattered Information:** Resources are unstructured, overly clinical, or difficult to understand  
- **Stigma & Social Isolation:** Many individuals feel misunderstood or judged  
- **Limited Practical Guidance:** Everyday coping strategies are rarely accessible  
- **Accessibility Gaps:** Websites often fail to accommodate neurodivergent needs  

**Sensory Hub** addresses these gaps by providing a **calm, accessible, and empathetic digital space** designed specifically for individuals with autism and ADHD.
